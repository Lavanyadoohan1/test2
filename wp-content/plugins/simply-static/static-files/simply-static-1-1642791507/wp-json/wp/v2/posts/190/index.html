Fans were overjoyed that Green Goblin had returned, and he was even more evil and sinister than before. In an interview with GQ, Dafoe revealed that he wanted to go all out for his iconic character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The Academy Award nominee had made it clear to director Jon Watts and producer Amy Pascal that he would not be content with a mere cameo. He desired something &#8220;meaty&#8221; that would meaningfully resurrect his character from the 2002 Spiderman film. &#8220;It&#8217;s fun to do the action sequences, and it&#8217;s fun to have resources,&#8221; Dafoe continued. He also stated that he usually works on low-budget films, but the Marvel franchise was a whole different ballgame.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">During the interview, Dafoe also praised his Spider-Man: No Way Home co-star Tom Holland for his professionalism and physical abilities. &#8220;I greatly admire his discipline and commitment to the role,&#8221; he said. And he was physically amazing.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Tom Holland also shared a hilarious anecdote about his first meeting with the Green Goblin actor on set, via Comicbook. While the resurrection of past Spiderman villains remained a mystery, the actors were required to wear black cloaks to conceal their identities. In true Peter Parker fashion, Holland ran into Willem Dafoe without realizing who he was and said, &#8220;Watch out, mate.&#8221; When Tom realized the cloaked entity was none other than Dafoe in flesh, he exclaimed, &#8220;Oh s**t, the Goblin is here.&#8221; The Cherry actor continued, &#8220;He was wonderful, he was truly wonderful. It was a pleasure to work with her.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Willem Dafoe&#8217;s reprised role as the Green Goblin garnered the most screams in the midst of all the buzz surrounding the new Marvel superhit film, Spiderman: No Way Home.
