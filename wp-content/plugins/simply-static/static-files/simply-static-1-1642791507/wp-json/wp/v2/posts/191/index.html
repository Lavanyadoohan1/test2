When it comes to luxury brands, everyone wants to get their hands on the newest piece and style it their own way. Warmer clothing, such as hoodies, sweaters, and jumpers, is still preferred as the weather remains cool. And Gucci is one of the world&#8217;s most desirable and well-known luxury brands. So it&#8217;s only natural that two of Bollywood&#8217;s hottest wore it at the same time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Kriti Sanon<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">When Kriti Sanon was dubbing for her upcoming film Bachchan Pandey in September, she showed off her cozy #ootd. The Mimi actress used her Instagram stories to tease fans with a sneak peek from her upcoming film. Kriti was seen wearing a pink Gucci Bananya hoodie as she shared a selfie from the studio with the caption, &#8220;Guess what I&#8217;m dubbing for?&#8221; as the actress struck a pose with no makeup and her hair pulled back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"227\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/DailyTopic\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/AASRvTe.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-207\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Katrina Kaif<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The newlywed actress was spotted at the airport earlier today, wearing the same pink Gucci Bananya hooded sweatshirt. Kat wore the oversized number to keep warm and paired it with latex leggings, Gucci shoes, and a face shield, with her hair, pulled away from her face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/DailyTopic\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/AASRAoz.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-208\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The pink hoodie was clearly a favorite of both divas, who looked adorable in it and put their own spin on it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Who, in your opinion, wore the Gucci sweatshirt better? Katrina Kaif or Kriti Sanon?
