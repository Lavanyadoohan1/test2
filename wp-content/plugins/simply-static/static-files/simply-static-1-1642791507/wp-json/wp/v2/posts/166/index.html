Kohli, in his first ODI since being replaced as full-time captain by Rohit Sharma, surpassed India legend Sachin Tendulkar as well as skippers Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid for two incredible records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Soon after coming to bat in the 297-run chase, the former India captain broke Sachin Tendulkar&#8217;s record for most runs in a way ODIs for the team. Tendulkar had 5,065 runs in away ODIs, and Kohli has now surpassed the Indian legend to take third place in the all-time list of most away runs in the fifty-over format. While Sri Lanka&#8217;s Kumar Sangakkara (5,518) is far ahead, Kohli can overtake Ricky Ponting (5,090) to finish second.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Prior to the first ODI, the Indian captain had 1,287 runs against the Proteas, surpassing two Indian batting legends \u2013 Dravid and Ganguly \u2013 as he reached the 27th run of his innings. Tendulkar, who has scored 2,001 runs against South Africa in ODIs, is only one run behind the former Indian captain.

Kohli trails Ricky Ponting (1,879), Kumar Sangakkara (1,789), Steve Waugh (1,581), and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (1,581). (1,559).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Kohli is not captaining the Indian team for the first time in nearly five years, regardless of the format. Last week, the 33-year-old shocked the cricket world by announcing his intention to step down as captain of the side in Test cricket. The announcement came just one day after India lost a 1-2 Test series to South Africa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Earlier, South Africa posted 296\/4 in the first ODI, with captain Temba Bavuma and Rassie van der Dussen scoring centuries. The hosts won the toss and chose to bat in Paarl, and the Indian bowlers were indifferent, with the exception of Jasprit Bumrah, who was the most economical in the attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Venkatesh Iyer made his ODI debut, and senior off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin returned to the team after a four-year absence.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Virat Kohli of India achieved two massive feats during the first ODI of the series against South Africa on Wednesday in Paarl.
