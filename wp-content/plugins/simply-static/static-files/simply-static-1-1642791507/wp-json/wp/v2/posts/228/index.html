There are advancements in various space travel means, such as a hot air balloon that will allow you to travel to the stratosphere. Another option for space travel is to use a plane that can transport both people and payloads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Radian Aerospace, based in Washington, is developing a spaceplane called &#8216;Radian One,&#8217; which recently received $27.5 million in seed funding. Radian One, the &#8220;world&#8217;s first fully functional horizontal takeoff and landing, single-stage to orbit vehicle,&#8221; will be developed with the funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">So far, the company has been operating in stealth mode, focusing on the design and early development of the space plane, and the new investment will propel it forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>The spaceplane Radian One<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Radian One will be shaped and designed like a plane, which means it will have wings, which will make a significant difference in spaceflight. As a result, it will carry out aircraft-like operations, delivering people and light cargo to low-Earth orbit (LEO). In contrast to current vertical liftoffs, the space plane will launch and land horizontally. However, the space plane will require some assistance during takeoff, which will be provided by a sled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Radian One will be able to perform a mission, refuel, and fly again 48 hours after touchdown, in addition to flying to space. The spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, with the ability to stay in orbit for five days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">According to space.com, the Radian One is also designed to fly here on Earth, with the ability to deliver up to 2,270 kgs anywhere in the world in less than an hour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">According to the company, its focus is not on space tourism, but on making space travel more convenient. &#8220;We are not focused on tourism; we are dedicated to missions that improve life on our own planet, such as research, in-space manufacturing, and terrestrial observation, as well as critical new missions such as rapid global delivery right here on Earth,&#8221; said Richard Humphrey, Radian&#8217;s CEO, and co-founder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Radian&#8217;s solution is said to be a low-cost space transportation system that can aid in the development of new aerospace markets. However, no launch date for the Radian One has been revealed as of yet, but the ambitious space plane is worth the wait.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Radian Aerospace is working on a spaceplane that can transport people and light cargo to low-Earth orbit.
