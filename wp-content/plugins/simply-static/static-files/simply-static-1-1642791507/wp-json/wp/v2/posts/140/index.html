The asteroid 7482, also known as 1994 PC1, was named by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and is about 1.6 km wide. It has been classified as a &#8220;potentially hazardous object&#8221; due to its proximity to Earth while shooting past.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">According to the space agency, an asteroid is &#8220;potentially hazardous&#8221; if it is 104 meters wide, larger than London&#8217;s Big Ben, and has orbits that bring it within 4.6 million miles of Earth&#8217;s orbit around the Sun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Furthermore, it can be a near-Earth object if it is closer than 1.3 au, where 1 au equals 93 million miles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Will the asteroid 1994 PC1, 7482 cause any harm to the Earth?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Asteroids of this size can cause damage to Earth, but NASA can be confident that 1994 PC1 will safely fly past the planet 1.2 million miles away on January 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">NASA posted on Twitter, &#8221; &#8220;Our #PlanetaryDefense experts have been studying the near-Earth #asteroid 1994 PC1 (1 km wide) for decades. Rest assured that 1994 PC1 will safely fly past our planet 1.2 million miles away on Tuesday, January 18.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>When will the 1994 PC1 come the closest to Earth?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">According to NASA Asteroid Watch, the potentially dangerous asteroid will make its closest approach to Earth on January 18 at 4.51 pm EST (3.21 am IST on January 19). It will be the closest approach for this asteroid for at least the next 200 years, according to astronomers&#8217; calculations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">On 15 February 2013, an asteroid called the Chelyabinsk meteor \u2014 roughly the size of a six-story building \u2014 broke up over Chelyabinsk, Russia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">NASA, the space agency, had previously launched a mission to smash a spacecraft into an asteroid as a test run to prevent a giant space rock from annihilating life on Earth. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) lifted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California at 10:21 p.m. Pacific Time on November 24, 2021, aboard a SpaceX rocket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Asteroid 2013 YD48 will pass Earth at a distance of 3,480,000 miles on January 11, 2022. Prior to that, at 47,000 miles per hour, an asteroid nearly three times the size of 2013 YD48 passed within 1.9 million miles of Earth.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jagran Trending Desk, New Delhi: Scientists have discovered that an asteroid the size of the Burj Khalifa will fly past Earth at a distance of 1,230,000 miles today, January 18.
