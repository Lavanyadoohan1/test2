Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young has also stated that the iPhone SE that will be released this year will be known as the iPhone SE+ 5G.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">As the name suggests, this smartphone will have 5G support and is expected to use the same 4.7-inch LCD panel as Apple&#8217;s previous 2020 iPhone SE, as well as the same design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">According to other reports, the iPhone SE+ 5G will have a single camera on the back with an LED flash. According to David Kowalski of Tentechreview.com, the 2022 iPhone SE could have a 5.69-inch screen. This information contradicts what Ross says about the screen size on the 2022 iPhone SE, so it remains to be seen which direction Apple will take with its affordable, compact iPhone SE series this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">According to Kowalski&#8217;s renders, Apple may forego the &#8220;massive forehead, chin, and ID button,&#8221; and the device may resemble the iPhone XR with its symmetrical bezels and notch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">According to the renders, the power button and SIM tray will be on the right, while the volume buttons and silent mode switch will be on the left. The speaker grills will be located on either side of the lightning port at the bottom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The iPhone SE+ 5G is expected to be released by Apple in March or April of this year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple will release the new iPhone SE in a few months, and this model is expected to resemble the older iPhone SE smartphones.
