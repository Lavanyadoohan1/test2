<p class="has-text-align-left has-medium-font-size">The launch of the Samsung Galaxy S22 series is just around the corner, with the company confirming that its Unpacked 2022 event will take place in February. Samsung promises that the next generation flagships will provide a better user experience. Samsung President TM Roh hinted in a blog post that the Galaxy S series could include a Note-series-like device as well. It is also expected to unveil its new Galaxy Tab S8 tablets at the event. Here&#8217;s a rundown of everything Samsung is expected to reveal next month.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The date of the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2022 event has been leaked.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">While the company has yet to confirm the event date, Ice Universe, a well-known leaker, claimed on Weibo that Samsung will hold its Galaxy Unpacked 2022 event on February 9. However, according to a report in the Korean publication DDaily, the event could begin on February 8. According to reports, the event will begin at 23:00 PM CST, which is 8:30 PM in India.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>What can we expect from the Samsung Unpacked 2022 event?</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is widely rumored to be the new Samsung Galaxy Note series phone this year, something that the company&#8217;s President has also hinted at. The terms &#8220;notable S series&#8221; and &#8220;the next evolution of Galaxy&#8221; both refer to the same thing. The company has also posted a short video on YouTube, implying that the brand intends to offer a mix of Galaxy S and Note series, which the Galaxy S22 Ultra may offer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">&#8220;At Unpacked in February 2022, we&#8217;ll unveil the most notable S series device we&#8217;ve ever created.&#8221; &#8220;The next generation of Galaxy S is here, combining the best of our Samsung Galaxy into one ultimate device,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">&#8220;We understand that many of you were disappointed when Samsung did not release a new Galaxy Note last year. You adored the Galaxy Note series&#8217; unrivaled creativity and efficiency, which allowed you to transition from gaming nirvana to high-octane productivity in the blink of an eye. You gushed about the lifelike S Pen, which many compare to writing with ink on paper. And we haven&#8217;t forgotten about the things you enjoy,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Samsung is expected to release three smartphones this year, including the Galaxy S22, Galaxy S22 Plus, and Galaxy S22 Ultra. The top-tier Ultra model is said to have a unique design. It may resemble Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Note phablets and include an S-Pen slot. According to previous rumors and leaks, this one will also have a curved display, similar to the Galaxy Note 20. The Galaxy S22 Ultra may have a large 6.81-inch screen. A 5,000mAh battery and a 108-megapixel quad-camera setup were also visible. A 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 10-megapixel 10x telephoto camera, and a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto camera are said to be included.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In some countries, all three Samsung Galaxy S22 smartphones will most likely be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. In India, the company could release devices with its new Exynos 2200 SoC and AMD graphics.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Galaxy S22 and its Plus variant are also expected to get camera upgrades, such as a beefier primary camera and improved optical zoom. Both handsets are expected to keep the old design and include a 50MP GN5 primary camera on the back. The standard model is expected to have a 6.01-inch screen, while the Plus is expected to have a 6.55-inch display.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Roland Quandt, a tipster, recently suggested that the company&#8217;s 2022 flagship could finally offer faster-charging speeds. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra model is expected to support 45W charging. However, because Samsung does not include a charger in the box of its flagship phones, the charging brick may have to be purchased separately. Furthermore, the other two models are said to have only 25W fast charging, which is similar to older models.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 series, in addition to the Galaxy S22 series, is expected to make its debut at the upcoming Unpacked 2022 event. While few details are known about the tablet&#8217;s specifications, it is expected to be powered by a Snapdragon 888 or Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. Three models could be unveiled by the company. The standard model is expected to have an 11.6-inch screen, while the Plus model may have a 12-inch screen. The Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra could have a massive 14.6-inch screen when it launches.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Whether it&#8217;s a mobile phone, a laptop, a tablet, or earbuds, nearly every personal gadget today is powered by a battery. However, Oppo, one of the world&#8217;s largest technology companies, believes that batteries are not the future, at least for IoT devices such as wireless earphones. It has now outlined a vision in which such devices will be powered by mobile signals, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth rather than batteries, which could change the way we use these products. Oppo has released a research paper titled &#8220;Zero Power Consumption Communication,&#8221; which focuses on a system that includes devices that consume no power.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Although it is only a theory at this point, the zero power consumption communication system will not use batteries for power and will instead rely on waves for charging. These devices will be ultra-portable and require much less power to operate, and with a battery-free mechanism, they will be longer-lasting and less expensive than current technology.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Batteries are an essential component of any personal electronic device that people carry with them. In contrast to the direct power supply system found on large appliances such as televisions and refrigerators, batteries enable devices to be portable. However, the way batteries work has several limitations.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The first and most important limitation is that they are consumable, which means they will become less effective and lose capacity as they age. Second, they take up a lot of room. If you&#8217;ve ever looked inside a smartphone, you&#8217;ll notice that the battery takes up the most space. They are also quite heavy. Given that they both use the same build material, a phone with a 6000mAh battery will most likely weigh more than a phone with a 4000mAh battery. Third, batteries are costly and add to the overall cost of your phone. Fourth, batteries are vulnerable to damage and explosions if the environment in which they operate changes slightly. You&#8217;ve probably heard about phones exploding. Finally, batteries are harmful to the environment.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Oppo wants to change everything. It has proposed technology for collecting radiofrequency energy from wireless connections such as mobile networks, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, which originate from RF sources such as TV towers, FM towers, mobile network base stations, and Wi-Fi hotspots. By modulating and relaying incoming signals, they will be able to communicate.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What Oppo has envisioned appears efficient and promising, and if implemented, could improve the ease with which we use some gadgets. However, it will mostly be limited to devices with low energy requirements, so it is difficult to imagine zero power consumption communication technology being able to power devices such as smartphones.</p>

<ul class="has-medium-font-size"><li>Radian Aerospace is working on a spaceplane that can transport people and light cargo to low-Earth orbit.</li></ul>



<ul class="has-medium-font-size"><li>The space plane will be fully reusable and capable of returning to Earth within 48 hours of landing.</li></ul>



<ul class="has-medium-font-size"><li>It will also be able to deliver up to 2,270 kgs anywhere in the world in under an hour.</li></ul>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">More people are flying to and from space, making space travel more accessible. There are advancements in various space travel means, such as a hot air balloon that will allow you to travel to the stratosphere. Another option for space travel is to use a plane that can transport both people and payloads.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Radian Aerospace, based in Washington, is developing a spaceplane called &#8216;Radian One,&#8217; which recently received $27.5 million in seed funding. Radian One, the &#8220;world&#8217;s first fully functional horizontal takeoff and landing, single-stage to orbit vehicle,&#8221; will be developed with the funds.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So far, the company has been operating in stealth mode, focusing on the design and early development of the space plane, and the new investment will propel it forward.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The spaceplane Radian One</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Radian One will be shaped and designed like a plane, which means it will have wings, which will make a significant difference in spaceflight. As a result, it will carry out aircraft-like operations, delivering people and light cargo to low-Earth orbit (LEO). In contrast to current vertical liftoffs, the space plane will launch and land horizontally. However, the space plane will require some assistance during takeoff, which will be provided by a sled.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Radian One will be able to perform a mission, refuel, and fly again 48 hours after touchdown, in addition to flying to space. The spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, with the ability to stay in orbit for five days.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to space.com, the Radian One is also designed to fly here on Earth, with the ability to deliver up to 2,270 kgs anywhere in the world in less than an hour.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to the company, its focus is not on space tourism, but on making space travel more convenient. &#8220;We are not focused on tourism; we are dedicated to missions that improve life on our own planet, such as research, in-space manufacturing, and terrestrial observation, as well as critical new missions such as rapid global delivery right here on Earth,&#8221; said Richard Humphrey, Radian&#8217;s CEO, and co-founder.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Radian&#8217;s solution is said to be a low-cost space transportation system that can aid in the development of new aerospace markets. However, no launch date for the Radian One has been revealed as of yet, but the ambitious space plane is worth the wait.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">We &#8220;We are in a new era of computing, in which the digital world expands beyond two-dimensional screens and enters &#8220;We are in a new era of computing, in which the digital world expands two-dimensional screens and enters the three-dimensional world,&#8221; said Rajiv Sodhi, chief operating officer of Microsoft India. &#8220;HoloLens 2 enables businesses and their employees to complete critical tasks faster, safer, and more efficiently, while also creating new ways to connect with customers and partners.&#8221; Microsoft India recently announced that the HoloLens 2 is now available in the country, bringing the capabilities and value of mixed reality solutions to Indian enterprises across industries.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For those who are unfamiliar, the HoloLens2 is an ergonomic, untethered self-contained holographic device with enterprise-ready applications to improve user accuracy and output. Mixed reality combines the physical and digital worlds, ranging from augmented reality to virtual reality. This augments the jobs of front-line workers in industries such as manufacturing, automotive, healthcare, and education, resulting in significant benefits for these businesses and industries.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Apollo Hospitals has developed an AI-powered Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score API that predicts an individual&#8217;s risk of having a cardiac event within the next seven years. Using the immersive mixed reality experience of the HoloLens 2, this API is combined with an individual&#8217;s health vitals to create a 3D visualization of the person&#8217;s heart&#8217;s current and future states. &#8220;By providing this immersive mixed reality experience and explaining the cause and effect of one&#8217;s lifestyle, the conversation between the doctor and patient has become much more personalized and impactful,&#8221; said Sathya Sriram, CEO of Apollo Hospitals Preventive Health.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Apple will release the new iPhone SE in a few months, and this model is expected to resemble the older iPhone SE smartphones. Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young has also stated that the iPhone SE that will be released this year will be known as the iPhone SE+ 5G.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As the name suggests, this smartphone will have 5G support and is expected to use the same 4.7-inch LCD panel as Apple&#8217;s previous 2020 iPhone SE, as well as the same design.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to other reports, the iPhone SE+ 5G will have a single camera on the back with an LED flash. According to David Kowalski of Tentechreview.com, the 2022 iPhone SE could have a 5.69-inch screen. This information contradicts what Ross says about the screen size on the 2022 iPhone SE, so it remains to be seen which direction Apple will take with its affordable, compact iPhone SE series this year.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to Kowalski&#8217;s renders, Apple may forego the &#8220;massive forehead, chin, and ID button,&#8221; and the device may resemble the iPhone XR with its symmetrical bezels and notch.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to the renders, the power button and SIM tray will be on the right, while the volume buttons and silent mode switch will be on the left. The speaker grills will be located on either side of the lightning port at the bottom.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The iPhone SE+ 5G is expected to be released by Apple in March or April of this year.</p>
