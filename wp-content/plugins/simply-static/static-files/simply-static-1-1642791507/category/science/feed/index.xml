<ul class="has-medium-font-size"><li>Radian Aerospace is working on a spaceplane that can transport people and light cargo to low-Earth orbit.</li></ul>



<ul class="has-medium-font-size"><li>The space plane will be fully reusable and capable of returning to Earth within 48 hours of landing.</li></ul>



<ul class="has-medium-font-size"><li>It will also be able to deliver up to 2,270 kgs anywhere in the world in under an hour.</li></ul>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">More people are flying to and from space, making space travel more accessible. There are advancements in various space travel means, such as a hot air balloon that will allow you to travel to the stratosphere. Another option for space travel is to use a plane that can transport both people and payloads.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Radian Aerospace, based in Washington, is developing a spaceplane called &#8216;Radian One,&#8217; which recently received $27.5 million in seed funding. Radian One, the &#8220;world&#8217;s first fully functional horizontal takeoff and landing, single-stage to orbit vehicle,&#8221; will be developed with the funds.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So far, the company has been operating in stealth mode, focusing on the design and early development of the space plane, and the new investment will propel it forward.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The spaceplane Radian One</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Radian One will be shaped and designed like a plane, which means it will have wings, which will make a significant difference in spaceflight. As a result, it will carry out aircraft-like operations, delivering people and light cargo to low-Earth orbit (LEO). In contrast to current vertical liftoffs, the space plane will launch and land horizontally. However, the space plane will require some assistance during takeoff, which will be provided by a sled.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Radian One will be able to perform a mission, refuel, and fly again 48 hours after touchdown, in addition to flying to space. The spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, with the ability to stay in orbit for five days.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to space.com, the Radian One is also designed to fly here on Earth, with the ability to deliver up to 2,270 kgs anywhere in the world in less than an hour.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to the company, its focus is not on space tourism, but on making space travel more convenient. &#8220;We are not focused on tourism; we are dedicated to missions that improve life on our own planet, such as research, in-space manufacturing, and terrestrial observation, as well as critical new missions such as rapid global delivery right here on Earth,&#8221; said Richard Humphrey, Radian&#8217;s CEO, and co-founder.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Radian&#8217;s solution is said to be a low-cost space transportation system that can aid in the development of new aerospace markets. However, no launch date for the Radian One has been revealed as of yet, but the ambitious space plane is worth the wait.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">We &#8220;We are in a new era of computing, in which the digital world expands beyond two-dimensional screens and enters &#8220;We are in a new era of computing, in which the digital world expands two-dimensional screens and enters the three-dimensional world,&#8221; said Rajiv Sodhi, chief operating officer of Microsoft India. &#8220;HoloLens 2 enables businesses and their employees to complete critical tasks faster, safer, and more efficiently, while also creating new ways to connect with customers and partners.&#8221; Microsoft India recently announced that the HoloLens 2 is now available in the country, bringing the capabilities and value of mixed reality solutions to Indian enterprises across industries.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For those who are unfamiliar, the HoloLens2 is an ergonomic, untethered self-contained holographic device with enterprise-ready applications to improve user accuracy and output. Mixed reality combines the physical and digital worlds, ranging from augmented reality to virtual reality. This augments the jobs of front-line workers in industries such as manufacturing, automotive, healthcare, and education, resulting in significant benefits for these businesses and industries.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to a recent Forrester Total Economic Impact Study commissioned by Microsoft, it provided a 177 percent return on investment over three years, as well as improvements in employee health and safety, business continuity, customer experience, and customer outcomes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Apollo Hospitals has developed an AI-powered Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score API that predicts an individual&#8217;s risk of having a cardiac event within the next seven years. Using the immersive mixed reality experience of the HoloLens 2, this API is combined with an individual&#8217;s health vitals to create a 3D visualization of the person&#8217;s heart&#8217;s current and future states. &#8220;By providing this immersive mixed reality experience and explaining the cause and effect of one&#8217;s lifestyle, the conversation between the doctor and patient has become much more personalized and impactful,&#8221; said Sathya Sriram, CEO of Apollo Hospitals Preventive Health.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Jagran Trending Desk, New Delhi:</strong> Scientists have discovered that an asteroid the size of the Burj Khalifa will fly past Earth at a distance of 1,230,000 miles today, January 18. The asteroid 7482, also known as 1994 PC1, was named by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and is about 1.6 km wide. It has been classified as a &#8220;potentially hazardous object&#8221; due to its proximity to Earth while shooting past.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to the space agency, an asteroid is &#8220;potentially hazardous&#8221; if it is 104 meters wide, larger than London&#8217;s Big Ben, and has orbits that bring it within 4.6 million miles of Earth&#8217;s orbit around the Sun.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Furthermore, it can be a near-Earth object if it is closer than 1.3 au, where 1 au equals 93 million miles.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Will the asteroid 1994 PC1, 7482 cause any harm to the Earth?</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Asteroids of this size can cause damage to Earth, but NASA can be confident that 1994 PC1 will safely fly past the planet 1.2 million miles away on January 18.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">NASA posted on Twitter, &#8221; &#8220;Our #PlanetaryDefense experts have been studying the near-Earth #asteroid 1994 PC1 (1 km wide) for decades. Rest assured that 1994 PC1 will safely fly past our planet 1.2 million miles away on Tuesday, January 18.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>When will the 1994 PC1 come the closest to Earth?</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to NASA Asteroid Watch, the potentially dangerous asteroid will make its closest approach to Earth on January 18 at 4.51 pm EST (3.21 am IST on January 19). It will be the closest approach for this asteroid for at least the next 200 years, according to astronomers&#8217; calculations.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">On 15 February 2013, an asteroid called the Chelyabinsk meteor — roughly the size of a six-story building — broke up over Chelyabinsk, Russia.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">NASA, the space agency, had previously launched a mission to smash a spacecraft into an asteroid as a test run to prevent a giant space rock from annihilating life on Earth. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) lifted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California at 10:21 p.m. Pacific Time on November 24, 2021, aboard a SpaceX rocket.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Asteroid 2013 YD48 will pass Earth at a distance of 3,480,000 miles on January 11, 2022. Prior to that, at 47,000 miles per hour, an asteroid nearly three times the size of 2013 YD48 passed within 1.9 million miles of Earth.</p>
